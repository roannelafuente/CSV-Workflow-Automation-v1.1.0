# CSV-Workflow-Automation-v1.1.0

📖 **Description**  
Third release of the CSV Workflow Automation Tool, now featuring **production-ready wafermap color coding**.  
Automates semiconductor deliverables by converting CSVs to Excel, generating pivot tables, validating End Test numbers, and creating wafermap visualizations for yield and defect tracking. Built with Python, Tkinter, OpenPyXL, and xlwings, it streamlines workflows and ensures reproducible, audit‑ready insights.

## 🚀 Features
- **CSV → Excel Conversion**  
  Converts raw CSV deliverables into structured Excel workbooks with professional formatting.  

- **Pivot Table Generation**  
  Automates fallout analysis by filtering `C1_MARK` values and calculating End Test fallout percentages.  

- **End Test Validation**  
  Locates and validates End Test numbers against reference tables, highlighting limit conditions.  

- **Wafermap Visualization (Production Color Codes)**  
  Deterministic wafermap coloring via defined `color_map`  
  Accurate `C1_MARK` lookup for ET mapping  
  Replicates workplace wafermap references for fidelity  

- **GUI Interface**  
  Tkinter‑based interface with:  
  - Scrollable status box for long logs  
  - Title and version labels for professional branding  
  - Developer attribution displayed in the interface
